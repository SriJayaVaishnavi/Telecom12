A hotfix is pending.</p><h3>Resolution</h3><p>The approved interim solution is to roll back the firmware to the last stable version (v3.12.9).</p><ol><li>Verify the issue by running a line test. Look for an excessive number of link flaps in the diagnostic output.</li><li>Inform the customer about the necessary rollback and the brief service interruption.</li><li>Use the 'Execute Firmware Rollback' quick action in the agent desktop. This triggers an API call to the provisioning system.</li><li>After the action completes (approx. 5-10 minutes), run the line test again to confirm the link is stable.</li><li>Confirm with the customer that the service is restored.</li></ol>"
